            An online grocer is either a brick-and-mortar<br> 
            supermarket or grocery store that allows online ordering, or a standalone e-commerce<br> 
            service that includes grocery items.[1][2] There is usually a delivery<br> 
            charge for this service. Online grocery delivery<br>
             services are available throughout Europe, Asia and North America, mostly<br>
              in urban centres. The online ordering is done through e-commerce websites<br>
               or mobile apps.

           The COVID-19 pandemic greatly accelerated the growth of online grocers, and in the first few months of the <br>pandemics online grocery shopping increased by 300%.[3] In addition, first-time online grocery shoppers accounted for 41% of online grocery shoppers.
